# HonorHero Ethics & Usage Guidelines

## Our Philosophy

HonorHero is built on a foundation of **encouragement, self-improvement, and human dignity**. This project exists to support learners, not to rank them.

## Intended Uses ✅

HonorHero is designed and encouraged for:

- **Personal Learning**: Individual practice and skill development
- **Music Education**: Teaching environments that prioritize growth over grades
- **Music Therapy**: Therapeutic settings focused on expression and wellbeing
- **Self-Assessment**: Private evaluation and progress tracking
- **Research**: Academic study of music learning and performance
- **Accessibility**: Adaptive music education for diverse learners
- **Community Building**: Supportive, non-competitive music communities

## Prohibited Uses ❌

HonorHero should **NOT** be used for:

- **Aggressive Competition**: Public leaderboards that shame or humiliate
- **Punitive Grading**: Using scores to punish or exclude learners
- **Ranking Systems**: Public rankings that foster unhealthy comparison
- **Automated Auditions**: Replacing human judgment in high-stakes evaluation
- **Surveillance**: Monitoring musicians without consent
- **Discrimination**: Any use that discriminates based on ability or background

## Design Principles

1. **Privacy First**: Performance data belongs to the individual
2. **Encouraging by Default**: All feedback should support growth
3. **Tolerance & Forgiveness**: Thresholds favor learners, not perfection
4. **Context Awareness**: Scores mean nothing without understanding the journey
5. **Human Dignity**: Every musician deserves respect, regardless of score

## For Educators

If you're using HonorHero in educational settings:

- Use it as a **feedback tool**, not a grading system
- Encourage students to **compete with their past selves**, not others
- Celebrate **progress** over absolute scores
- Make data **private** unless students choose to share
- Discuss the **limitations** of automated evaluation

## For Developers & Contributors

When contributing to HonorHero:

- Prioritize **encouragement** over accuracy
- Make **tolerances forgiving** by default
